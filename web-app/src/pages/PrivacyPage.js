          <H>Who we are</H>
          <P>
            Lebanon Relief Network was founded by a group of Lebanese expats and
            international volunteers from various backgrounds in August 2020, in
            the aftermath of the double explosion that rocked the port of
            Beirut, Lebanon’s capital.{" "}
          </P>
          <P>
            LRN’s mission is to help the residents of Lebanon and individuals
            from the Lebanese diaspora who experienced a traumatic event,
            regardless of their political and religious affiliations, by
            connecting them to volunteers, to professionals and to each other
            while suggesting tools that can help them get the support and care
            they need.{" "}
          </P>
          <P>
            LRN aims to create a healthier, more trauma-informed and resilient
            Lebanon where those who need help can access self-help solutions and
            connect with professionals and available support systems.{" "}
          </P>
          <P>
            We are committed to protecting your personal information and making

          <P>We collect information from you in the following ways: </P>
          <P>
            - <u>When you interact with us directly:</u> This could be if you

            us through platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram or

          <P>
            Data Protection Law recognises that some categories of personal
            information are more sensitive. Sensitive Personal Information can

            political opinions, sex life, sexual orientation or religious
            beliefs (“Sensitive Personal Information”). Sometimes, we may ask
            you what your link is to trauma. We ask for this information simply
            so that we can understand more about people who follow us and
            support us. It can help us to provide you with information that is
            more relevant to you, and it can help us represent you better. If
            you provide us with any Sensitive Personal Information by telephone,
            email or by other means, we will treat that information in the most
            careful and confidential manner possible and always in accordance

            happy to share your personal details with staff members or if you
            would like us to share your story with other parties or the media as
            part of our missiong to raise awareness about trauma.{" "}
          </P>
          <P>
            If you contact us through a survey, by e-mail, by phone, in person
            or other more general communications, you may choose to provide
            details of a sensitive nature. We will only use this information:
          </P>

            - For the purposes of dealing with your enquiry, training, and
            quality monitoring or evaluating the services we provide.

          <P>
            - We will not pass on your details to anyone else without your

          <P>
            h) to run/administer our Website, keep the Website safe and secure
            and ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner
            for you and for your device; Î
          </P>

          <H>Legal Basis for using your information </H>
          <P>
            We will only use your Personal Data where we have your consent or
            because we need to use it in order to fulfil a contract with you.
          </P>
          <P>
            a) However, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requires
            us to rely on one or more lawful bases to process your personal
            information. We consider the grounds listed below to be relevant:
          </P>
          <P>
            b) Where you have provided your consent for us to use your personal
            information in a certain way{" "}
          </P>
          <P>
            c) Where necessary so that we can comply with a legal obligation to
            which we are subject (for example, where we are obliged to share
            your personal information with regulatory bodies which govern our
            work and services)
          </P>
          <P>
            d) Where necessary for the performance of a contract to which you
            are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a
            contract (for example, if you apply to work for/ volunteer with us)
          </P>
          <P>
            e) Where it is in your/someone else’s vital interests (for example,
            in case of a medical emergency).
          </P>
          <P>
            f) Where there is a 'legitimate interest' in us doing so. This means
            that the reason that we are processing information is because there
            is a legitimate interest for LRN to process your information. The
            GDPR allows us to collect and process your personal information if
            it is reasonably necessary to achieve our or others’ legitimate
            interests (as long as that processing is fair, balanced and does not
            unduly impact your rights).Whenever we process your Personal Data
            under the 'legitimate interest' lawful basis we make sure that we
            take into account your rights and interests and will not process
            your personal information if we feel that there is an imbalance.
            Some examples of where we have a legitimate interest to process your
            Personal information are where we contact you about our work via
            post, use your personal information for data analytics, conducting
            research to better understand who our supporters are, improving our
            services, or for our legal purposes (for example, dealing with
            complaints and claims).

          <H>Marketing</H>
          <P>
            LRN will only contact you for marketing purposes where you have
            provided us with consent to do so. If you agree for us to contact
            you through one of these channels we might send you information
            about our work and how you can help us to make sure that everyone
            experiencing trauma receives both support and respect.{" "}
